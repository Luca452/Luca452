âš¡ Turn on, tune in, drop out...here's some of my projects

## ðŸ›  Personal Projects:
- [STM32 Custom Development Board](https://github.com/Luca452/STM32-DevBoard): a small portable STM32 development board, initially designed to be used as a keychain keylogger
- [STM32 Nucleo Audio codec shield - Real time audio processing using Miosix RTOS](https://github.com/Luca452/STM32-DevBoard): an STM32 Nucleo audio shield for real time audio processing, designed with @AleDedor
- [Sun Simulator for testing of small sized solar cells](https://github.com/Luca452/Sun-Simulator): Sun simulator for testing of small sized solar cells, used for the Perovskite solar cells mounted on 6S CubeSat
- [Supercapacitors-UPS based on 2x100F supercapacitors](https://github.com/Luca452/Supercapacitor-UPS): UPS based on 2x100F supercapacitors because...why not! (actually 100 reasons why not but...hey!)
- [Digital Thermometer based on LM335](https://github.com/Luca452/Digital-Thermometer-ATMEGA328P): simple digital thermometer based on LM335 sensor using an ATMEGA328P
  
## ðŸŽ“ University Projects:
- [Digital Electronics System Design course LABs code](https://github.com/Luca452/Digital-Electronics-System-Design-LABs): code of the 3 projects done during the semester. VHDL designs targeting a Basys 3 Artix 7 FPGA board
