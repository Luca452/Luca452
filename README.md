âš¡ Turn on, tune in, drop out...here's some of my projects

## ðŸ›  Personal Projects:
- [STM32 Custom Development Board](https://github.com/Luca452/STM32-DevBoard): a small portable STM32 development board, initially designed to be used as a keychain keylogger
- [STM32 Nucleo Audio codec shield - Real time audio processing using Miosix RTOS](https://github.com/Luca452/STM32Nucleo-Codec-Shield): an STM32 Nucleo audio shield for real time audio processing, designed with @AleDedor
- [Characteristic tracer for low power solar cells](https://github.com/Luca452/Solar-cell-characteristics-tracer): Circuit for tracing and measuring the full I-V characteristic, the open circuit voltage and short circuit current of a solar cell pixel. Used to test the circuit architecture that will be implemented on the [6S CubeSat](https://polispace.it/6s-cubesat-project/)'s payload.
- [Sun Simulator for testing solar cells pixels](https://github.com/Luca452/Sun-Simulator): sun simulator for testing small sized solar cells, used for the Perovskite solar cells mounted on the 6S CubeSat
- [Supercapacitors-UPS based on 2x100F supercapacitors](https://github.com/Luca452/Supercapacitor-UPS): UPS based on 2x100F supercapacitors because...why not! (actually 100s of reasons but...hey!)
- [Digital Thermometer based on LM335](https://github.com/Luca452/Digital-Thermometer-ATMEGA328P): simple digital thermometer based on a LM335 sensor and an ATMEGA328P
  
## ðŸŽ“ University Projects & Materials:
- [Digital Electronics System Design course LABs codes](https://github.com/Luca452/Digital-Electronics-System-Design-LABs): codes of the 3 projects done during the semester. VHDL designs targeting a Basys 3 Artix 7 FPGA board
- [Sensors Systems course LABs code](https://github.com/Luca452/Sensors-Systems-LABs): codes of the 10 homeworks assigned during the semester. C codes targeting a Nucleo STM32 board mounted on a custom extension PCB
- [Microcontrollers course LABs codes](https://github.com/Luca452/Microcontrollori-LABs): codes of the 9 homeworks assigned during the semester, targeting a PIC18F45K22 microcontroller
